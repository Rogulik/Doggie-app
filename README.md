Hello!

This my submission with all of the code from development side. Please feel free to evaluate and give me a feedback.

From the technical side:

- I used JavaScript instead of TypeScript to not spending any more time on declearing types, because I know that this is only for me and no one else gonna work on this project and also the app is quiet small so it is easy to catch any bugs,

- For global state I use useContext and useReducer built in hooks, because as I mention before the app doesn't reuqire so much of a redux
at this point,

Hope You liked my code!
Thank You for Your time and effort in checking out my work!

Kind Regards
Marcin Rygielski
